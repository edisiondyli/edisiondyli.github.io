## About Me

I am currently a masterâ€™s student at [Visual, Sensing and Intelligent System Laboratory (VSISLab)](http://www.vsislab.com/), [Key Laboratory of Machine Learning and System Control, Ministry of Education of PRC](https://misc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University (SDU)](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I am dedicated to exploring efficient frameworks for robotic skill learning that can make general-purpose robots a reality.

<p style="color: red;">**I'm looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025.**</p>

**We plan to attend IROS2024, see you in Abu Dhabi!**

## Research Interests
