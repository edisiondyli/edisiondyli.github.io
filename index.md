## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the J. Mike Walker '66 Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I am fortunate to work with [Dr. Zhiwen Fan](https://zhiwenfan.github.io/).

Before joining TAMU, I obtained my master's degree in June 2025 at [Visual, Sensing and Intelligent System Laboratory (VSISLab)](http://www.vsislab.com/), [Key Laboratory of Machine Learning and System Control, Ministry of Education of PRC](https://misc.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University (SDU), under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://vsislab.github.io/Weizhang/).
